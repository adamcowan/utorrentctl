Getting Started
---------------

Download utorrentctl.py and config.py. Edit config.py to edit your connection defaults.
It's not required, but it's more convenient to have them. Run python utorrentctl.py --help.
utorrentctl detects that it is run as command line utility and displays usage help. There
is no documentation at the moment, so for basic usage refer to the example code in
utorrentctl.py (after if __name__ == '__main__')


Requirements
------------

- Python 3.1+ (http://www.python.org/download/)
- Any OS (right now only tested on Linux)

Option --dir needs some clarification. When specified with --add it changes download directory
only for torrent being added. It accepts both full path and relative path. Full path is pretty
self-explanatory, but relative path is rather tricky. Suppose we have the following:

  download_dir = /home/user/downloads
  --dir=movie

then program will strip last path of download_dir (it will become /home/user) and will add
specified dir to it, thus it will become /home/user/movie

Such behavior allows you to have a single directory where most of your torrent go, but
gives you the possibility to change it download_dir to some top-level directory temporary.
